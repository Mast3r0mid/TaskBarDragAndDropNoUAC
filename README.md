# Drag&Drop(win11 No UAC)

TaskBar Drag And Drop(No UAC) allows you to enable Drag & Drop functionality on the Taskbar in Windows 11 even when UAC (User Account Control) is turned off or when you are using the Built-in Administrator Account. This tool removes the need for <code>UndockingDisabled</code> or the restoration of the <code>classic taskbar</code>.
